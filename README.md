# CSharpText
A CSharp program processing textual data and printing a summary of the results. 
There are some unit tests added to test some functions in the code.

There are two C# code files and three input text files.

The "Program.cs" file contains the solution class called "Aggregate" and class Program with Main function.
The main function works as a test driver function to the functions in Aggregate class.

The "UnitTest.cs" file contains the unit tests for two of the functions in Aggregate class.

The files "inputTest.txt", "badTestInput1.txt" and "badTestInput2.txt" are the input files that must be placed in "C:\Users\Public\" for three of the unit tests to work correctly.


Assumptions:
I assume that there are no duplicate entries and no inconsistencies in the input data to be processed correctly.
I also assume that the names of the countries, cities and gender (i.e. Male/Female) are spelled the consistenly.
